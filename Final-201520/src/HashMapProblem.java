	 * Using an ArrayList of Strings, we want to track the letter count for
	 * every word.  To do this, we will map an integer (the letter count) to
	 * an array list of words for each of the respective letter counts.
	 * 
	 * For Example:
	 * Given the ArrayList: ["Hello", "there", "how", "are", "you", 
	 *                       "doing", "I". "am", "fantastic"]
	 * The HashMap would contain:
	 * 		{(1, ["I"]), (2, ["am"]), (3, ["how", "are", "you"]), 
	 *       (5, ["Hello", "there", "doing"]), (9, ["fantastic"])}
	 * 
	 * You may assume that all the words in the ArrayList are unique, that is
	 * a particular word only appears in the list once.
	 * 
	 * @param words an ArrayList of individual words as Strings
	 * @return a HashMap that maps word letter count to an ArrayList of words which
	 *         contain that many letters
