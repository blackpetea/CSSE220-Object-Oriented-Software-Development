	/**
	 * Given two 2D arrays of the same size, add the two 
	 * arrays together, treating the arrays as matrices.
	 * This means that the item at 0,0 in the first array
	 * is added to the item at 0,0 in the second array, and 
	 * the sum is placed in 0,0 of the result array. This 
	 * is repeated for each location in the 2D arrays.
	 * 
	 * Here is an example of a sample run:
	 * int[][] first = {
	 *			{1, 2, 3},
	 *			{4, 5, 6},
	 *			{7, 8, 9}};
	 * 
	 * int[][] second = {
	 *			{1, 2, 3},
	 *			{4, 5, 6},
	 *			{7, 8, 9}};
	 *
	 * The result would be:
	 * result = {
	 *			{2,   4,  6},
	 *			{8,  10, 12},
	 *			{14, 16, 18}};
	 *
	 * @param first The first 2D array
	 * @param second The second 2D array
	 * @return the result array of the two arrays added together
